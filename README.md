Tasks:
- Move groups of css classes to their own SCSS module/file (unbundle)
- Make a proposal for the refactoring style (extract commonly used colors, fonts, dimensions) similar to this https://zellwk.com/blog/css-architecture-3/
- Refactor CSS code by using SCSS features (variables, modules, partials, no nesting, mixins, extend/inheritance)
- Avoid style duplication
- While refactor the code use our staging environment to see if there are no design regressions
